# with the driver's own core count. The driver now runs inside a small batch
# allocation (see ssh_slurm.DRIVER_CPUS), where 'all' resolves to that
# allocation's handful of cores; gtdbtk's threads: 64 silently became 4, and
# sbatch rejected the child job because Negishi's highmem partition requires at
# least 64 cores. Any ceiling at or above the largest rule's threads: restores
# the declared value; 256 is the biggest node on this cluster, so no rule can
# usefully ask for more. This does not oversubscribe the driver: in cluster mode
# it is --local-cores, defaulting to the host's real core count, that bounds the

    The waves exist because GTDB-Tk runs as ONE batch across every genome,
    while output_cache restores GTDB-Tk outputs per genome. Genomes already
    restored need nothing from that batch, so making them share its DAG put
    their RASTtk behind a run they had no stake in:

      batch    GTDB-Tk, only when some genome actually still needs it
      ready    RASTtk for genomes whose GTDB-Tk outputs are already on disk
      pending  RASTtk for the rest, started only once the batch has landed

    "ready" runs concurrently with "batch" -- different tools, disjoint
    outputs. The two RASTtk waves never overlap: run_rasttk drives BV-BRC's
    remote service, which must see one submission at a time, so "pending" is
    launched only after "ready" has exited (each wave is itself --jobs=1).

    Both RASTtk waves share the output_dir's .snakemake metadata, so the
    batch's provenance is already recorded by the time "pending" builds its
    DAG and it does not re-run GTDB-Tk.

        Build snakemake command from workflow key and config.

        Args:
            key: WorkflowKey defining the workflow
            config_overrides: Only workflow-specific overrides (input_fasta, output_dir, main_database)
            mode: Execution mode ('dev' for local-only; anything else uses slurm executor)
            compute_config: Compute cluster config (account, partition, resources)
            extra_resources: Optional named Snakemake resources (--resources k=v ...) to cap
                concurrency of a specific group of rules independently of --jobs, e.g.
                {'margie_sb_phase4_slot': 4} to let only 4 phase4 tools run at once.
            rerun_triggers: Optional value for Snakemake's --rerun-triggers (e.g. 'mtime').
                None (default) leaves the combined input+code+params triggers untouched;
                resume_job's relaunch asks for 'mtime' since a resumed run's output_dir
                always has a new timestamp, which combined triggers would otherwise
                treat as a params change and rerun everything.
            target: Optional explicit Snakemake target rule name (e.g. 'rasttk_all' or
                'phase4_12_one_genome' -- see margie_sb.smk) instead of the implicit
                rule all. Must come before --config (which greedily consumes every
                following token as key=value). Also passes --nolock, since
                _run_pipeline_batch_sequential runs 'rasttk_all' concurrently with a
                sequence of 'phase4_12_one_genome' targets against the same working
                directory -- safe because the two touch disjoint rule sets and outputs.
            max_jobs_override: Caller-specified --jobs value that wins over
                compute_config's max_jobs. Used by Stage 1's rasttk_all invocation
                (see _run_pipeline_batch_sequential) to force real BV-BRC submissions
                one at a time -- a named Snakemake resource pool was tried for this
                instead (margie_sb_phase3_slot) and deadlocked a real run (pool stuck
                at 0 with jobs never selected), so concurrency is capped here via
                Snakemake's own --jobs scheduler instead, which every cluster executor
                already has to get right. Safe because Stage 1's whole DAG is just
                gtdbtk+rasttk -- nothing else needs the higher Stage 2 concurrency.

        they run breadth-first across every genome via one long-running
        Snakemake invocation targeting rule rasttk_all (Stage 1). Every
        local-compute phase (4-8) plus that genome's consolidation (phase9),
        labeling (phase10), and scoring (phase11) instead processes ONE
        genome fully via rule phase4_12_one_genome (Stage 2) before starting
        the next.

        Stage 1 is launched with max_jobs_override=1 (see build_executable):
        its whole DAG is just gtdbtk+rasttk, and only one genome's real
        BV-BRC submission may ever be in flight (margie_sb.smk's run_rasttk
        also holds its own mkdir mutex around the BV-BRC call as a backstop,
        but without this --jobs=1 cap Snakemake still submits up to
        compute_config's max_jobs worth of rasttk SLURM jobs that just idle
        on that mutex, wasting cluster allocation and starving other phases
        of account quota -- observed live on 2026-06-26).

        Genomes become eligible for Stage 2 in the order their RASTtk+GTDB-Tk
        output became ready (polled via each genome's RASTtk token file), since
        that's the only order BV-BRC's queue can be observed in. Among the
        genomes ready at any moment, though, Stage 2 processes the MOST-COMPLETE
        one first (most phase outputs already on disk -- see
        _genome_stage2_progress): time-to-first-result matters, so a genome that
        is minutes from a final result must not wait behind one that needs hours,
        and the slowest (least-complete) genomes are left for last. A genome's
        Stage 2 failure halts the queue there -- deliberate: later genomes, even
        ones already RASTtk-ready, are not processed this run.

        Same setup (sif validation, per-genome output_cache restore/store)
        as _run_pipeline_batch() -- only the "how Snakemake actually runs"
        middle section differs.
