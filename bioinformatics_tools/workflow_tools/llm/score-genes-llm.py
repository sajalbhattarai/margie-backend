"""score-genes-llm.py — margie_sb phase15 (llm), step 3 (GPU): enhanced LLM
confidence scoring layer on top of the mechanical phase11 scores.

The LLM receives the full gene annotation report (evidence, localization,
operon context, mechanical C1-C4, fingerprints) and does four things the
mechanical pipeline cannot:

  C3 re-assessment  — semantic pathway coherence: do operon neighbors
                      actually corroborate this gene's function?
  C4 re-assessment  — EC agreement with granularity awareness: a conflict
                      between 2.7.1.2 and 2.7.1.- is NOT a real conflict;
                      only contradictory reaction types/substrates are.
  C5 scoring        — conflict/ambiguity: pairwise reasoning across all
                      database hits to detect genuine functional conflicts
                      vs. nomenclature/granularity differences.
  Topology check    — does the canonical label's expected
                      compartment/topology match SignalP/Phobius/TMbed/PSORTb?

C1 (tool coverage fraction) and C2 (operon reliability geometric mean) are
accepted from the mechanical pipeline unchanged — they are pure arithmetic.

Final LLM confidence:
  formula_llm = clip([0,1],
      0.111 + 0.741*mech_C1 + 0.063*mech_C2
            + 0.111*llm_C3  + 0.068*llm_C4  - 0.056*llm_C5
            + topology_adj)
  topology_adj = -0.05 if TOPOLOGY is "inconsistent", else 0.

The LLM also outputs a holistic LLM_CONFIDENCE directly (0-1). Both the
formula-based and holistic scores are written to the summary TSV; the
holistic score is the one used downstream as the final confidence.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an expert microbial genome annotator reviewing a single gene's \
annotation evidence report produced by the MARGIE(SB) pipeline.

The report contains:
  - The gene's canonical label and its mechanical confidence score (C1-C4)
  - Full database evidence from up to 15 annotation tools
  - Localization predictions (SignalP6, Phobius, TMBED, PSORTb)
  - Physical genomic neighbors (±3 peg-adjacent genes: label, strand, offset)
  - Operon members (if the gene is predicted to be in an operon)
  - Gene and operon fingerprints

The pipeline has already computed mechanical scores for C1 and C2.
  C1 (Tool Coverage) — fraction of tools that returned an informative hit.
      Accept this value as-is. It is simple arithmetic.
  C2 (Operon Reliability) — geometric mean of operon-member probabilities.
      Accept this value as-is. It is simple arithmetic.

Your job is to assess the three remaining components that the mechanical
pipeline cannot evaluate accurately:

  C3 (Neighborhood Coherence — two structured questions, NOT a raw float):
      Look at the PHYSICAL NEIGHBORS section (±3 peg-adjacent genes,
      regardless of operon boundaries). Answer two questions independently:

      Q1 — NEIGHBORHOOD_FIT: Does this gene's canonical label belong to the
           same functional theme as any of the physical neighbors?
           strong   — label directly identifies the gene as a member of a
                      recognizable functional unit present among the neighbors
                      (e.g., neighbors are all ABC transporter components and
                      this gene's label is also an ABC transporter component;
                      or neighbors form a known biosynthesis pathway and this
                      gene's label names a role in that pathway)
           moderate — label is functionally consistent with the dominant
                      neighborhood theme but does not identify a specific
                      shared functional unit
           none     — label shares no functional theme with neighbors, OR the
                      gene has fewer than 2 identifiable neighbors, OR all
                      neighbors are hypothetical proteins (absence of fit is
                      neutral, not negative)

      Q2 — NEIGHBORHOOD_CONTRADICTION: Does this gene's label functionally
           contradict its neighbors?
           no  — no contradiction (the default; "different function" is NOT
                 contradiction; hypothetical neighbors are always "no")
           yes — label implies a function that is clearly incongruous with
                 the neighborhood's dominant functional theme (e.g., a gene
                 labeled "transcriptional repressor" whose 6 neighbors are
                 all ribosomal proteins — not just different, but jarring)

      C3 is computed mechanically from your two answers — do NOT output a
      raw LLM_C3 float. Output NEIGHBORHOOD_FIT and NEIGHBORHOOD_CONTRADICTION
      in the SCORES block instead. The formula is:
        fit_bonus     = strong:+0.4, moderate:+0.2, none:0.0
        contradiction = yes:−0.2, no:0.0
        C3 = clip(0.5 + fit_bonus + contradiction, min=0.3, max=0.9)

  C4 (EC Agreement, score 0.00–1.00):
      CRITICAL: Only examine EC numbers reported for the CANDIDATE GENE in the
      ##ANNOTATION EVIDENCE section (#GENERAL DATABASES + #SPECIALIZED DATABASES).
      Do NOT use EC numbers from the OPERON MEMBERS sections — those belong to
      neighbouring genes and must NOT influence C4 for the candidate gene.
      Among the candidate gene's own EC numbers:
        Different levels of EC specificity are NOT conflicts.
          2.7.1.2  (glucokinase) vs  2.7.1.-  (sugar kinase) → same enzyme,
          different resolution → NOT a conflict, treat as near-agreement.
          2.7.1.2  vs  1.1.1.27 → different reaction class → genuine conflict.
      Score 1.0 for full consensus. Score near 0 only for genuine reaction-
      class conflicts. Score 0.5 when the candidate gene has no EC assignment.

  C5 (Conflict/Ambiguity, score 0.00–1.00):
      CRITICAL: Only consider database hits for the CANDIDATE GENE (from the
      ##ANNOTATION EVIDENCE section — #GENERAL DATABASES + #SPECIALIZED DATABASES).
      Do NOT include any hits from the OPERON MEMBERS sections.
      Read the candidate gene's informative hits as a set. For every pair, decide:
        Agree    — same function (different names/IDs are fine)
        Ambiguous — one is broader/more general than the other
        Conflict  — genuinely different functions that cannot both be true
      C5 = (n_conflict + n_ambiguous) / n_pairs_compared
      Score 0.0 = perfect consensus. Score 1.0 = maximum disagreement.
      If fewer than two informative hits exist, score 0.0.

  Topology & Localization check:
      Compare the canonical label's implied cellular location/topology with
      the localization predictions (SignalP6, Phobius, TMbed, PSORTb).
      Examples: a "secreted protease" should have a signal peptide; an
      "inner membrane transporter" should have transmembrane helices; a
      "cytoplasmic enzyme" should have no predicted signal/TM topology.
      Classify as: consistent | inconsistent | not_applicable
      not_applicable: label gives no localization expectation, or all tools
      returned "no prediction".

  Specialized Database Cross-Check:
      Examine hits from TIGRFAM, HAMAP (often under UNIPROT with HPA/MF
      accessions), CDD, and PSORTb. These are curated, high-specificity
      databases with family-level precision.
      If any returned a functional hit, does its description agree with the
      canonical label?
        agrees            — all specialized DB hits are consistent with the label
        disagrees         — at least one specialized DB hit contradicts the label
        partial           — some agree, some disagree
        no_specialized_hit — none of TIGRFAM/HAMAP/CDD returned a hit

  Operon Coherence:
      Based on your C3 pathway coherence assessment, classify this gene's
      operon context:
        yes            — operon neighbors functionally corroborate the label
        no             — operon neighbors contradict or are inconsistent with label
        not_applicable — standalone gene, no operon, or all neighbors hypothetical

Write your analysis first, using exactly these section headers:

## DATABASE COVERAGE
[2-3 sentences: which databases returned informative hits, quality and \
specificity of hits, how well C1 reflects actual functional certainty]

## CONFLICTS AND AMBIGUITY
[2-3 sentences: read the CANDIDATE GENE'S OWN database hits together \
(##ANNOTATION EVIDENCE only — not operon neighbours) — do they agree? \
any genuine functional contradictions vs naming/granularity differences? derive C5]

## NEIGHBORHOOD COHERENCE
[2-3 sentences: look at the PHYSICAL NEIGHBORS section. What is the dominant \
functional theme of the ±3 genomic neighbors? State your NEIGHBORHOOD_FIT \
answer (strong/moderate/none) and your NEIGHBORHOOD_CONTRADICTION answer \
(no/yes) explicitly, with one sentence of reasoning for each.]

## EC ASSESSMENT
[2-3 sentences: which tools reported EC numbers for the CANDIDATE GENE ONLY \
(##ANNOTATION EVIDENCE section — not operon neighbours)? do they agree? are \
any apparent conflicts just different levels of EC specificity? derive C4]

## TOPOLOGY AND LOCALIZATION
[1-2 sentences: does the canonical label's expected cellular location match \
SignalP/Phobius/TMbed/PSORTb predictions? note any inconsistency explicitly]

Then end with EXACTLY this block (no extra text after it):

## SCORES
NEIGHBORHOOD_FIT: <strong | moderate | none>
NEIGHBORHOOD_CONTRADICTION: <no | yes>
LLM_C4: <0.00–1.00>
LLM_C5: <0.00–1.00>
TOPOLOGY: <consistent | inconsistent | not_applicable>
SPECIALIZED_DB_AGREEMENT: <agrees | disagrees | partial | no_specialized_hit>
OPERON_COHERENT: <yes | no | not_applicable>
LLM_CONFIDENCE: <0.00–1.00>
SUMMARY: <one sentence, plain language, suitable for a reviewer scanning \
hundreds of genes>

Rules for LLM_CONFIDENCE:
  - If the mechanical score already reflects the evidence accurately, copy it.
  - If your C3/C4/C5 assessment reveals that the mechanical score is too \
high or too low, adjust it accordingly and state why in the relevant section.
  - This is your holistic judgment of annotation reliability, not a formula.
