SSH-based SLURM operations for interfacing with HPC clusters.

Uses paramiko to run login node and SLURM commands. Since we use Snakemake,
which controls SLURM batching and queueing, we can mainly run on login node.

All functions are API-layer only. Pass a per-user SSHConnection built
with make_user_connection() for every call.

    reattach=True skips the launch entirely and only streams: the run is
    already going, started by an earlier (now dead) dane-api, and its log and
    exit sentinel are still on disk under the same job_id. cmd is ignored in
    that mode. The tail has always started at line 1 precisely so this would
    replay everything the lost session saw -- until now nothing called it, so a
    dane-api restart meant a live run's job page went permanently blank: no
    logs, no SLURM jobs, phase frozen wherever it was when the API died.

    Yields each output line as it arrives, then a final __EXIT_CODE__: line.
    The contract is unchanged; how the process is hosted is not.

    Previously this did exec_command(..., get_pty=True) and read the channel
    directly, which tied the run's lifetime to the SSH session. Because
    margie.sh traps EXIT and kills the remote dane-api, quitting the GUI closed
    that session, tore down the PTY, and SIGHUP'd dane_wf -- the Snakemake
    driver. Already-submitted SLURM jobs kept running, but nothing further was
    ever submitted, so a run silently stalled half-finished whenever the user
    closed their laptop. A genome annotation takes hours; that is not a
    reasonable thing to require.

    Now the command is started with setsid + nohup, writing to a log file, and
    its exit status to a sentinel. Streaming is a SEPARATE concern: we tail the
    log. Losing the tail (closed GUI, dropped VPN) loses only the live output --
    the run continues, and reattaching later replays the log from the top.
