"""
Centralized SSH connection configuration.

Provides a single place to manage host, username, and connection setup
instead of hardcoding paramiko boilerplate in every function.

All SSH/SFTP operations are API-layer only. The CLI runs directly on the
cluster and has no need to establish outbound SSH connections.

API usage:
    Call make_user_connection(host, username, private_key_str), which reads
    the user's cluster credentials from the database record, loads the
    decrypted private key into memory (never written to disk), and returns
    a ready SSHConnection.

# is why the file and history lists felt slow: almost all of the wait was
# reconnecting, not listing.
