"""
Job execution and monitoring.

Contains the core SSH task runner that streams remote output, parses logs
for SLURM job IDs, Snakemake progress, and container metadata, and the
SLURM status checker daemon thread.

The `connection` parameter threads a per-user SSHConnection through from the
API router all the way to the SLURM status checker daemon, so every SSH call
hits the correct cluster and account.

# load_<tool>_to_db share one SLURM submission per genome, see margie_sb.smk's
# group: directives), only the group's own short name ("rasttk") is captured
# -- the rest of that path segment is the snakemake-generated concatenation
# of every rule in the group, which read as a confusing "rule name" on its
# own (e.g. showing "load_rasttk_to_db_run_rasttk" made it look like only the
# load step ran, when the run step's actual annotation work happens in the

# This is the cheapest source there is -- no SSH, no waiting for a remote file

# not survive into this log), and get_job_genome greps the job's own remote log,
# which races that file being cleaned up when the job finishes quickly.

# have no genome wildcard, so their path is .../rule_x/<slurm_id>.log with
