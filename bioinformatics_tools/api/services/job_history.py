"""
Persistent job history, backed by the user's own main_database SQLite file.

job_store.py is deliberately in-memory only (fast, simple, good enough for
actively-streaming logs) -- but that means every dane-api restart wipes all
job records, and there's no way to list "my past jobs" at all. This module
is the persistence layer underneath it: every job gets a row here at
creation, kept in sync as job_store.update() reports status/work_dir
changes, so job history survives restarts and can be listed/resumed.

Deliberately a SEPARATE table from workflow_tools/output_cache.py's
run_log -- run_log is written by the workflow process itself (even for
direct CLI runs with no API involved at all) and keyed on its own run_id;
this table is keyed on the API's job_id specifically, the identifier the
front-end actually navigates with (/jobs/{job_id}).

main_database is a path on the user's cluster account, not necessarily
the machine dane-api itself runs on (each user has their own
cluster_host/cluster_username) -- so the API never opens this file
directly. It invokes this module's functions over SSH instead, as
`python -m bioinformatics_tools.api.services.job_history <action>` with a
JSON payload on stdin and a JSON result (if any) on stdout; see
api/services/job_history_client.py for the calling side.
