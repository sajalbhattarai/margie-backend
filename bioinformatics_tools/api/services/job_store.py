"""
In-memory job state management.

Provides a JobStore class that wraps the jobs dict with structured
methods for creating, reading, and updating job state. All job state
mutations go through this module.

This in-memory store is wiped on every dane-api restart and has no way to
list a user's past jobs. job_history_client.py persists a small subset of
fields (status/phase/work_dir) to the user's own main_database over SSH so
that history survives restarts -- create()/update() are the single
chokepoint for all job state changes, so hooking persistence in here means
job_runner.py (which calls update() many times per job) needs no changes
at all. Persistence is opportunistic: it only fires when a job was created
with persist_db_path/persist_connection, and a failure to persist never
raises -- see job_history_client.py's module docstring.

# How often a run's SLURM/container provenance is written to history while it

# It used to be written once, by finalize(). That made provenance depend on the
# API surviving to the end of the run, and it does not always: when the SSH log
# stream drops ("'NoneType' object has no attribute 'open_session'"), the job
# was finalized four minutes into a run whose in-memory list was still empty,
# so an empty list is what got snapshotted -- and the SLURM Jobs table read
# empty forever afterwards, for a run that went on to submit 458 jobs and whose
# log recorded every one of them. Three consecutive runs lost their provenance
# that way.
#
# Every history write is an SSH round-trip, so per-log-line persistence really
# would be too expensive -- but per-30-seconds is not. That is a fraction of
# what the SLURM status checker beside it already spends on its own 15s cycle,
# and it caps the loss at the last half-minute instead of everything.
