# Make this computer its own "cluster", so the API can be developed without HPC.
#
# The API does its work by SSHing into a login node, running dane_wf from
# ~/bioinformatics-tools, and submitting to SLURM. On a laptop all three can be
# the laptop itself:
#
#   ssh        Remote Login (sshd) on, and a key kept only for this, allowed in
#              to your own account (~/.ssh/authorized_keys, tagged margie-dev)
#   dane_wf    ~/bioinformatics-tools linked to this checkout -- the same link
#              the API makes for itself on start (main.py) when it is safe to
#   SLURM      sbatch / squeue / sacct / scancel from ./bin, on the PATH that
#              non-interactive SSH commands see (~/.zshenv, tagged margie-dev)
#
# Everything it adds is tagged, and --undo takes it all out again.
#
#   ./setup.sh            set it up (idempotent)
#   ./setup.sh --dry-run  say what it would change, change nothing
#   ./setup.sh --undo     remove everything it added
